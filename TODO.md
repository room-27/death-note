# TODO

## Soon

  - [X] Add functionality for manually switching page and adding/retrieving details separately
  - [ ] Ability to modify details within time constraints after writing PIDs, and lock page afterwards
  - [ ] Prompt indicator for when page is locked, optional 'next' function to create new page with next free id (can use pre-created pages that are still without targets)
