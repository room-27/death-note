#DEATH NOTE

##How to use it


The process whose PID is written with this notebook shall die.

This note will not take effect unless the writer has the process firmly in their mind when writing its PID. Processes cannot have the same PID and so multiple processes will not be directly affected.

If the cause of death is written within the next 40 seconds of writing the process's PID, it will happen.
If the cause of death is not specified, the process will simply die of a SIGTERM.
After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds (or until the specified time).

This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the ground of (arrives in) the human world.
The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of the original owner, i.e. a Superuser of Death.
The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.

If the time of death is not specified, the process will die in the 40 human seconds.
If the time of death is written within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a SIGTERM, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the PID.
The human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a Superuser of Death, even if the human is not the owner of the note.

The person in possession of the Death Note is possessed by a Superuser of Death, its original owner, until they die.
If a human uses the note, a Superuser of Death usually appears in front of them within 39 days after they use the note.
Superusers of death, the original owners of the Death Note, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note.
A Superuser of Death has no obligation to completely explain how to use the note or rules which will apply to the human who owns it unless asked.

A Superuser of Death can extend their own life by putting a PID on their own note, but humans cannot.
A person can shorten their system's life by using the note.
The human who becomes the owner of the Death Note can, in exchange of half their remaining system's life, get the eyeballs of the Superuser of Death which will enable them to see a process's PID and remaining life span when looking through them.
A Superuser of Death cannot be killed even if stabbed in the heart with a knife or shot in the head with a gun. However, there are ways to kill a Superuser of Death, which are not generally known to the Superuser of Death.

The conditions for death will not be realized unless it is physically possible for that human or it is reasonably assumed to be carried out by that human.
The specific scope of the condition for death is not known to the Superusers of Death, either. So, you must examine and find out.

One page taken from the Death Note, or even a fragment of the page, contains the full effects of the note.
The instrument to write with can be anything, as long as it can input text directly onto the note and produces legible letters.
Even the original owners of Death Note, Superusers of Death, do not know much about the note.

Even if you do not actually possess the Death Note, the effect will be the same if you can recognize the process and their PID to place in the blank.

This Death Note will still affect processes under 780 days old.
The Death Note will be rendered useless if the process's PID is misspelled (i.e. no valid process exists for the specified PID) four times in a row.

Suicide is a valid cause of death. Basically, all processes are thought to possess the possibility to unpredictably halt. It is, therefore, not something unbelievable to think of.
Whether the cause of the process's death is either a suicide or accident, the death may lead to the death of more than the intended, depending on which other processes depend on it.

Even after the process's PID, the time of death, and death condition on the Death Note are filled out, the time and condition of death can be altered as many times as you want, as long as it is changed within 6 minutes and 40 seconds from the time it was filled in. But, of course, this is only possible before the victim dies.
Whenever you want to change anything written on the Death Note within 6 minutes and 40 seconds after you wrote, you must type out the command followed by its arguments again.
As you see above, the time and conditions of death can be changed, but once the victim's PID has been written, the individual's death can never be avoided.

If you lose the Death Note or have it stolen, you will lose its ownership unless you retrieve it within 490 days.
If you have traded the eye power of a Superuser of Death, you will lose the eye power as well as the memory of the Death Note, once you lose its ownership. At the same time, the remaining half of your life will not be restored.

You may lend the Death Note to another person while maintaining its ownership. Subletting it to yet another person is possible, too.
The borrower of the Death Note will not be followed by a Superuser of Death. The Superuser of Death always remains with the owner of the Death Note.
Also, the borrower cannot trade the eyesight of the Superuser of Death.

When the owner of the Death Note dies while the Note is being lent, its ownership will be transferred to the person who is holding it at that time.
If the Death Note is stolen and the owner is killed by the thief, its ownership will automatically be transferred to the thief.

When the same PID is written on more than two Death Notes, the note which was first filled in might take effect first, but this is not guaranteed.
If writing the same PID on more than two Death Notes is completed within a .06 seconds, it is regarded as simultaneous; but the Death Note will still take effect and the individual written can die.

The Superuser of Death must at least own one Death Note. That Death Note must never be lent to or written on by a human.
Exchanging and writing on the Death Note between the Superusers of Death is no problem.

If the Superuser of Death decides to use the Death Note to kill the assassin of an individual they favor, the individual's life will be extended, but the Superuser of Death will die.

The dead Superuser of Death will disappear, but the Death Note will remain. The ownership of this Death Note is usually carried over to the next Superuser of Death that touches it, or is kept in possession of the human owner of the Death Note.

Only by touching each other's Death Note can human individuals who own the Death Note in the human world recognize the appearance or voice of each other's Superuser of Death.
An individual with the eye power of a Superuser of Death can tell the PID and life span of processes by looking at their address space. By possessing the Death Note, an individual gains the ability to kill, and stops being a victim. The Superuser of Death must not tell humans the PIDs or life spans of processes they see running. This is to avoid confusion in the human world.

It is prerequisite for the Death Note used in the human world that a living Superuser of Death makes sure that the humans in the human world use it.
It is very difficult to consider that a Superuser of Death who has possessed a human could die, but if they should die, the Death Note that they brought into the human world will not lose its power.

In order to see the PIDs and life spans of processes by using the eye power of the Superuser of Death, the owner must look at more than half of that process's address space. When looking from top to bottom, they must look at least at the user-space. If they look at only the kernel-space and under, they will not be able to see the process's PID and life span. Also, even though some parts of the address space are hidden, if they can basically see the whole thing, they will be able to see the process's PID and life span. It is still not clear how much exposure is needed to tell a process's PID and life span, as this needs to be verified.
If above conditions are met, PIDs and life spans can be seen through memory dumps, no matter how old they are. But this is sometimes influenced by the vividness and size. Also, PIDs and life spans cannot be seen by drawings or analog media.

Those with the eye power of the Superuser of Death will have the eyesight of over 3.6 in the human measurement, regardless of their original eyesight.

The individuals who lose the ownership of the Death Note will also lose their memory of the usage of the Death Note. This does not mean that they will lose all the memory from the day they owned it to the day they lose possession, but means they will only lose the memory involving the Death Note.

Whenever an individual with ownership of more than two Death Notes loses possession to one of the Death Notes, they will not be able to recognize that Death Note's Superuser of Death's appearance or voice anymore. The Superuser of Death themself will leave, but all the memory involving that Death Note will remain as long as they maintain ownership of at least one other Death Note.

The Superuser of Death must not stay in the human world without a particular reason. Conditions to stay in the human world are as follows:

1. When the Superuser of Death's Death Note is handed to a human.
2. Essentially, finding a human to pass on the Death Note should be done from the world of the Superusers of Death, but if it is within 82 hours this may also be done in the human world.
3. When a Superuser of Death stalks a process with an intention to kill it, as long as it is within 82 hours of haunting it, the Superuser of Death may stay in the human world.

The Superuser of Death must not hand the Death Note directly to a child under 6 years of age based on the human calendar.
The Death Note must not be handed to a child under 6 years of age, but Death Notes that have been dropped into the human world, and are part of the human world, can be used by humans of any age with the same effect.

If you just write, "die of crash" for the cause of death, the victim will die from a natural crash after 6 minutes and 40 seconds from the time of writing it.
Even though only one PID is written in the Death Note, if it influences and causes other processes that are not written in it to die, the victim's cause of death will be a SIGTERM.

You cannot kill processes at the age of 124 years or over with the Death Note.
You cannot kill processes with less than 12 minutes of life left in human calculations.

If you have traded the eye power of a Superuser of Death, you will see a process's primary life span in the human world.
The PIDs you will see with the eye power of a Superuser of Death are the PIDs needed to kill that process.

The number of pages of the Death Note will never run out as far as storage permits.

If a person loses possession of a Death Note, they will not recognize the Superusers of Death by sight or voice any more. If however, the owner lets someone else touch their Death Note, from that time on, that person will recognize the Superuser of Death.
In accordance with the above, the human who touched the Death Note and began to recognize the Superuser of Death's image and voice, will continue to recognize it until that human actually owns the Death Note and subsequently loses possession of it.

The owner of the Death Note cannot be killed by a Superuser of Death who is living in the world of the Superusers of Death.
Also, a Superuser of Death who comes to the human world, in the objective to kill the owner of the Death Note, will not be able to do so.
Only a Superuser of Death that has passed on their Death Note to a human is able to kill the owner of the Death Note.

If a Death Note owner accidentally misspells a PID four times, that process will not actually be free from being killed by the Death Note.

The process whose PID was misspelled four times on purpose will also not be free of death by a Death Note.

When regaining ownership of the Death Note, the memories associated with the Death Note will also return. In cases where you were involved with other Death Notes as a well, memories of all the Death Notes involved will return.
Even without obtaining ownership, memories will return just by touching the Death Note.

You will lose memory of the Death Note when losing its ownership. But you can regain this memory by either obtaining the ownership once again or by touching the Death Note. This can be done up to 6 times per Death Note.
If the 6 times are exceeded, the person's memory of the Death Note will not return and they will have to use it without any previous memory of it.

Humans that have traded for the eye power of a Superuser of Death will see a process's primary life span, and will not be influenced by the Death Note. If the victim is killed using the Death Note, the remaining lifetime of that process will be provided to the Superuser of Death.

Humans that have traded for the eye power of a Superuser of Death cannot see the PID or life span of process that have already terminated by looking at their files.

Whenever a Superuser of Death who had been in the human world dies the Death Note is left behind and is picked up by a human, that person becomes the owner.
However, in this case, only the human that can recognize the Superuser of Death and its voice is able to see and touch the Death Note.
It is very unlikely, but if by any chance a Superuser of Death picks up the Death Note, that Superuser of Death becomes the owner.

The PID you see with the eye power of a Superuser of Death is the PID needed to kill that process. You will be able to see their PID even if they aren't listed anywhere.

It is useless trying to erase PIDs written in the Death Note with erasers or white-out.

The use of the Death Note in the human world sometimes affects other process's lives or shortens their original life span, even though their PIDs are not actually written in the Death Note itself. In these cases, no matter the cause, the Superuser of Death sees only the original lifespan and not the shortened lifespan.

If a Death Note is owned in the human world against the Superuser of Death's will, that Superuser of Death is permitted to stay in the human world in order to retrieve it.
In that case, if there are other Death Notes in the human world, the Superusers of Death are not allowed to reveal to humans that Death Note's owner or its location.

If the Death Note that the Superuser of Death owns is taken away by being cheated by other Superusers of Death and so forth, it can only be retrieved from the Superuser of Death who possesses it at the time. If there is no Superuser of Death, but a human possessing it, the only way that the Superuser of Death can retrieve it will be to first touch the Death Note and become the Superuser of Death that haunts that human. Then wait until that human dies to take it away before any other human touches it, or whenever the human shows a will to let go of it.

As long as the Superuser of Death has at least once seen a process and knows their PID and life-span, the Superuser of Death is capable of finding that process from a hole in the world of the Superusers of Death.

There are laws in the world of Superusers of Death. If a Superuser of Death should break the law, there are 9 levels of severity starting at Level 8 and going up to Level 1 plus the Extreme Level. For severity levels above 3 the Superuser of Death will be killed after being punished.
For example, killing a process without using the Death Note is considered as the Extreme Level.

Losing memory of the Death Note by passing on the ownership to another, or by abandoning its ownership will only occur when a process is actually killed using that Death Note. You will not lose memory of the Death Note, for example, if you merely owned it and had not written any process's PID. In this case, you will not be able to hear the voice or see the figure of the Superuser of Death any more. You will also lose the eye power of the Superuser of Death you traded with.

The Superuser of Death will not die from lack of sleep. Moreover, Superusers of Death do not really need sleep. The meaning of sleep for Superusers of Death is essentially different from humans and is merely laziness.
Especially Superusers of Death living in the human world that have passed on their Death Note shouldn't be lazy, as they are required to see the death of the human, but it is not that they are not allowed to sleep.

Any number of Death Notes are allowed to exist at a time in the human world. Of course, the Death Note that the Superuser of Death owns does not count. This many Superusers of Death that have passed on their Death Note to humans can stay in the human world.

One Superuser of Death is allowed to pass on Death Notes to only 3 humans at a time.
It is possible for a single Superuser of Death to hand out up to 6 Death Notes, for example, by handing 3 humans 2 Death Notes each.

In the event that there are more than 6 Death Notes in the human world, only the 6 most recently used Death Notes that have been delivered to humans will have effect.
The seventh Death Note will be able to become active when one of the other 6 Death Notes is not instanteneously in use.

The Death Note will not take effect if you write a specific victims PID using several different pages.
But the front and back of a page is considered as one page.

In order to make the Death Note take effect, the process's PID must be written on the same page, but the cause of death and situation around the death can be described in other pages of the Death Note. This will work as long as the person that writes in the Death Note keeps the specific process's PID in mind when writing the cause and situation of death.

In occasions where the cause and situation of death is written before the victim's PID, multiple PIDs can be written as long as they are written within 40 seconds and the causes and situations of death are not impossible to occur.
In the occasion where the cause of death is not possible, that PID will die of a SIGTERM, unless the process is under the protection of an L (Lack of permission).

When you write multiple PIDs in the Death Note and then write down even one cause of death within 40 human seconds from writing the first victim's PID, the cause will take effect for all the written PIDs.

In the Death Note, you cannot set the death date longer than the process's original life span. Even if the victim's death is set in the Death Note beyond their original life span, the victim will die before the set time.

By manipulating the death of a process that has influence over another process, that process's original life span can sometimes be lengthened.
If a Superuser of Death intentionally does the above manipulation to effectively lengthen a process's life span, the Superuser of Death will die, but even if a human does the same, the human will not die.

A process death caused by the Death Note will indirectly lengthen some other process's original life even without a specific intention to lengthen a particular process's original life span in the human world.

After a Superuser of Death has brought the Death Note to the human world and given its ownership to a human, that Superuser of Death has the right to kill the human using their own Death Note for reasons such as disliking the owner.

Even if a new victim's PID, cause of death, or situation of death is written on top of the originally written PID, cause of death or situation of death, there will be no effect on the original victim's death. The same thing will also apply to erasing what was written with a pencil, or whitening out what was written with a pen, in attempt to rewrite it.

Once the victim's PID, cause of death and situation of death have been written down in the Death Note, this death may not take place if that Death Note in which it has been written is destroyed, for example, uninstalled, before the stated time of death.
If the process's PID has been written and then the Death Note is removed in the middle of writing the cause of death, the victim will be saved.
If the victim's PID and cause of death have been written and the Death Note is destroyed or closed, in the middle of writing the time of death, then the victim will not be killed within 6 minutes and 40 seconds via the stated cause of death due to obvious technical concerns.

No matter what medical or scientific method may be employed, it is impossible for humans to distinguish whether or not the human has the eye power of a Superuser of Death. Even Superusers of Death cannot distinguish this fact, except for the very Superuser of Death that traded their eye power with that human.

The following situations are the cases where a Superuser of Death that has brought the Death Note into the human world is allowed to return to the world of Superusers of Death:

1. When the Superuser of Death has seen the end of the first owner of the Death Note brought into the human world and has written that human's name on their own Death Note.
2. When the Death Note which has been brought in is destroyed, like burned, and cannot be used by humans anymore.
3. If nobody claims the ownership of the Death Note, and it is unnecessary to haunt anyone.
4. If, for any reason, the Superuser of Death possessing the Death Note has been replaced by another Superuser of Death.
5. When the Superuser of Death loses track of the Death Note which they possess, cannot identify which human is owning the Death Note, or cannot locate where the owner is, and therefore needs to find such information through the hole in the world of Superusers of Death.

Even in the situations 2, 3, and 4 above, Superusers of Death are obliged to confirm the death of the first owner and write down that human's name in their Death Note even when they are in the world of Superusers of Death.

In the world of Superusers of Death there are a few copies of what humans may call user guidebooks for using the Death Note in the human world. However, the guidebook is not allowed to be delivered to humans. Even this README is an incomplete approximation to the inner working of the Death Note.
It is perfectly okay for Superusers of Death to read the guidebook for themselves and teach humans about its contents, no matter what the content may be.

Some limited number of Death Notes have white or red front covers, but they would make no difference in their effects, as compared with the black cover Death Notes.

All process will, without exception, eventually terminate.
After they die, the place they go is MU. (Nothingness)

Once dead, they can never come back to life.
